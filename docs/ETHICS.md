# Ethics & Disclaimer

HeadlessX is a powerful tool designed for legitimate data gathering, testing, and automation purposes. We strongly condemn the use of our software for malicious activities, including but not limited to DDoS attacks, credential stuffing, bypassing paywalls for piracy, or any action that violates the target website's Terms of Service or applicable laws.

## Responsible Scraping Guidelines

When using HeadlessX, we recommend adhering to the following ethical scraping principles:

### 1. Respect `robots.txt`
Always check the target website's `robots.txt` file to understand their crawling policies. While HeadlessX can technically bypass blocks, respecting the site owner's wishes is a hallmark of ethical data collection.

### 2. Request Throttling
Do not overwhelm target servers with excessive requests. Use delays between actions to minimize load on the target infrastructure. High-frequency scraping can degrade service for legitimate users.

### 3. Personal Data & Privacy
Avoid scraping sensitive personal data (PII) unless you have explicit consent or a legitimate legal basis (e.g., GDPR compliance). If you accidentally collect personal data, ensure it is handled securely or deleted immediately.

### 4. Copyright & Intellectual Property
Respect copyright laws. Data scraped from public websites may still be protected. Do not republish scraped content in a way that infringes on the original owner's intellectual property rights.

## Disclaimer

**HeadlessX is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.**

By using this software, you agree that:

1.  **You are solely responsible for your actions.** The developers of HeadlessX accept no liability for any legal consequences, damages, or bans resulting from your use of this tool.
2.  **Compliance is your duty.** It is your responsibility to ensure that your scraping activities comply with all applicable local, national, and international laws, as well as the Terms of Service of the websites you interact with.
3.  **No guarantee of availability.** While we strive for a 0% detection rate, anti-bot technologies evolve constantly. We do not guarantee uninterrupted access to any specific target website.

## Abuse Reports

If you discover that HeadlessX is being used for illegal or malicious purposes, please report it to our team immediately or open an issue in our GitHub repository. We are committed to maintaining a tool that benefits the developer community responsibly.
